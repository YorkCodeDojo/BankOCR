	<h1>York Code Dojo</h1>
    <h2>Feb 2025 - OCR Bank Kata</h2>

	<aside class="notes">

        I'm David Betteridge,  a software developer from York.  

        I normally work in c# and I must admit I know very little about PHP.

        I do however run the York Code Dojo group and I' a co-founder of the York Developers charity.

        Who has been to a Code Dojo before?

        The idea is that it's a place to practice programming without the pressures of work/school.  It doesn't matter
        if you don't complete the problem - as long you learn and have fun.

        Also,  it gives you the oppotintity to try out new ideas,  languages or working with different people.

        Like driving a car - you might drive 10 miles to work every day,  but if it's the same route you won't really
        be improving.

        The code of conduct is simple - be nice to each other.  And ensure we all get a chance to learn and enjoy the evening

        If you have any issues,  please let me know.

        I'll explain the problem.  Different every Month,  Advent of code this time.

        Divide up into pair or threes.

        At the end you can present the solution to the group - or not if you don't want to.

        It would be great you could upload your solutions to GitHub at the end.
